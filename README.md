## Repo news

* April 22nd:
    - We have been learning how to deal with git branches in this project.
    - We have then created a branch called feature/mytest to add a new component called MyTest. We had a problem at the end. The solution was just to modify the line 11 in backend/routes/user.routes.js, so that it stays: router.get("/", users.findAll);
    - In this meeting Carlos Sánchez, Néstor Cabanillas and Néstor Batista have already installed successfully Tiburcio's reference project, and were actively adding the new MyTest component. Aaron and Texe were still with the boilerplate actions such as installing MySQL. They plan to have during this week a meeting to finally install it all.
* April 15th:
    - We have been learning how to deploy the whole start project Tiburcio had been working on this last Eastern, starting cloning the project from github, and then installing all the stuff for both the frontend and backend, following the instructions in this github project. At least Carlos Sánchez could install it all successfully. Some other students were also successfull too or were near to achieve it.

## Prerequisites

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/bluecity.git
```

This project contains 2 different parts:
* Frontend
* Backend

You need a node.js working environment. The LTS is recommended: https://nodejs.org/es/

Once you have cloned your project install all dependencies.

```
cd bluecity/frontend
npm install

cd bluecity/backend
npm install
```

* For your frontend part, if you want to use the Google Login feature, you have to create a clientID by creating a new project on Google developers website.: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in

Your Google ClientID should be inserted in the file: bluecity/frontend/src/components/my-login-with-google.js

```
client_id: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com',
```

* For your backend part:
1. You need a .env file with a key for the JWT:

```
    JWT_SECRET=V3RY#1MP0RT@NT$3CR3T#
```

2. You need a mysql server working.

3. You have to edit the file bluecity/backend/config/config.json, depending on your environment.

```
    "username": "root",
    "password": "your password",
    "database": "bluecity_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "operatorsAliases": 0
```

4. Create the mysql database, that in our case is "bluecity_development".

5. Do the migration creating the tables with the contents of /bluecity/migrations 

```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

6. And populating the tables with data with the contents of /bluecity/seeders

```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

Finally to start enjoying this project.
